# Plant_Disease

Introduction

• Diseases and pests are the major problems in agriculture. These require careful analysis and timely treatment to protect the crops from massive loss.
• Automatic detection of plant leaf diseases is an important research topic as it can prove advantageous in observing large crop fields and thus enable automatic detection of diseases based on signs present on plant leaves. Moderately visual identification is less accurate and time-consuming than image processing identification
• This automated system is designed to overcome the problems of manual techniques. Images can be taken with an ordinary digital camera or a high-resolution mobile phone camera. That image is given as an input to the system for gaining the leaf attribute.
• This project will aim to provide a free-of-cost application to farmers located even in the country's most remote locations, with an easy hands-on user interface.

Problem Statement

• Diseases are the natural factor that can cause some severe effects on plants, which ultimately reduces productivity.
• The naked eye observations of experts are the primary approach used in observation for the detection of plant diseases. But, this needs
continuous monitoring of experts.
• When there is a large farm, this approach might be prohibitively expensive.
• In some developing countries like India, farmers may have to go long distances to contact specialists, this makes consulting specialists too
expensive, and a time-consuming farmer is unaware of non-native diseases. These can be a severe problem in some cases because this may
lead to severe effects for the plants and the crop of the farmer.
